# Notes-App-Flask

To-Do-List made with the Python programming language and using the Flask framework.

In this application you can create tasks to have them written down and not forget about them. One of the main features is that you need to be connected to use the application, so it has a Log In and Sign Up system.

Once inside, you can create the tasks you want and delete them later.
